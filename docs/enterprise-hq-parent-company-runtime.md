## Persistent successor-lease recovery proposals (local, review-only)

scripts/enterprise_hq_recovery_ledger.py extends the unified task, budget, lease, and untrusted-receipt ledger with a recovery_proposals table and a separate recovery_audit_events chain.

- requires the exact task proposal and exact expired first-attempt lease envelope to exist in the same local ledger;
- validates the successor with the pure recovery contract, requiring attempt 2, a distinct lease ID, no overlap with the previous lease, an expired prior lease, and side_effects_started=false;
- derives a deterministic recovery ID from the task, prior lease, successor lease ID, and successor-envelope digest;
- persists at most one successor proposal per task and at most 256 recovery proposals;
- treats an identical proposal as idempotent and rejects a different successor for the same task;
- atomically writes the recovery proposal and its own sequenced SHA-256 audit event;
- verifies all inherited task, budget, lease, receipt, and recovery chains before appending and after restart;
- refuses to extend a corrupted recovery chain;
- keeps the row PROPOSED_FOR_HUMAN_REVIEW, with successor_lease_issued=false, automatic_retry=false, and execution_authorized=false.

The persisted successor is a proposal only. It is not inserted into the active lease table, does not claim or renew a lease, and does not resume a task. The local owner-supplied logical identity remains unauthenticated. This is not a distributed lock service or multi-host recovery coordinator.

## Fail-closed principal attestation contract (adapter required)

scripts/enterprise_hq_principal_contract.py defines task-bound worker and reviewer
attestation envelopes. Worker assertions bind to the exact task proposal and lease;
reviewer assertions bind to the exact task proposal and verification receipt.

- validates exact schema, task/proposal binding, role, audience, issuer/key identifiers,
  Ed25519 signature encoding, nonce syntax, timezone-aware validity window, and a
  maximum 15-minute attestation lifetime;
- delegates cryptographic signature and trust-chain checks to an injected verifier
  adapter; the module contains no trust store, key retrieval, network client, or default
  verifier;
- fails closed with IDENTITY_VERIFIER_UNAVAILABLE when no adapter is configured;
- sanitizes adapter exceptions and rejects false or non-boolean adapter results;
- returns only task/role/binding status and always keeps execution_authorized=false.

The test suite uses a synthetic verifier only. It does not establish production
authentication, key custody, nonce replay prevention, identity lifecycle management,
or independent reviewer independence. A trusted adapter and persistent replay store
must be separately reviewed and authorized before operational use.

## Persistent principal nonce replay protection (local, fail-closed)

scripts/enterprise_hq_principal_replay_ledger.py extends the task, budget, lease,
receipt, recovery, and principal-attestation contracts with a durable one-time nonce
ledger.

- verifies the task-bound principal attestation through the explicitly injected
  verifier adapter before attempting nonce consumption;
- requires the referenced task and worker lease proposal, or reviewer receipt claim,
  to exist in the same local ledger with the exact task proposal digest;
- scopes nonce uniqueness to issuer and principal ID, so a previously accepted nonce
  cannot be reused by that principal across tasks;
- permits only one accepted worker identity per lease proposal and one reviewer
  identity per receipt claim;
- serializes concurrent consumers with the inherited SQLite BEGIN IMMEDIATE
  transaction and unique constraints;
- persists only a SHA-256 nonce fingerprint and attestation digest, never the raw
  nonce, signature, subject, or full attestation payload;
- writes a separate sequenced SHA-256 audit chain and verifies all inherited chains
  before append and after restart;
- caps retained nonce uses at 1,024 and fails closed when capacity is reached;
- never deletes expired records automatically, so replay history is not silently
  discarded;
- keeps execution_authorized=false and never issues a lease or resumes a task.

The replay ledger is local SQLite state, not a distributed replay cache. Its hash
chain detects inconsistent or accidental modification but is not a keyed tamper-proof
seal against an attacker who can rewrite the entire database. The synthetic verifier
used by tests is not a production identity provider. Production key custody, trusted
issuer registration, revocation, cross-host replay coordination, and independently
authenticated reviewer identity remain unimplemented.
